The Falkland Islands conflict between the UK and Argentina reached its peak in 1982 when Argentina invaded the islands, sparking the Falklands War. The conflict stemmed from centuries-old territorial claims by Argentina, which the UK rejected, maintaining that the islands had been a British Crown Colony since 1841. The British government, led by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at the time, launched a military task force to retake the islands. The ensuing conflict lasted ten weeks and resulted in the deaths of 649 Argentine military personnel, 255 British military personnel, and three Falkland Islanders. The war ended with the surrender of Argentine forces, who withdrew from the island, leaving the Falklands under British control.
Since the end of the Falklands War, the sovereignty dispute has remained a sensitive and potent issue within Argentine politics. Successive Argentine governments have maintained a claim over the islands, considering them a part of Argentina's territory. The claim is embedded in the Argentine constitution, and the islands' status is commemorated annually on April 2nd in Argentina as "Malvinas Day." Diplomatic tensions occasionally flare up, especially during elections in Argentina, where politicians often assert the claim as a matter of national pride and identity.
On the other hand, the British government has consistently held that the future of the Falkland Islands should be determined by the islanders themselves. In a 2013 referendum, Falkland Islanders voted overwhelmingly in favor of remaining a British overseas territory. The UK's stance is that there is no sovereignty dispute to discuss, as long as the islanders wish to remain British. Internationally, the UK has received support from most of its allies, who recognize the self-determination rights of the Falklanders. However, the dispute continues to affect UK-Argentina relations, with both countries seeking to manage the diplomatic sensitivities while occasionally engaging in discussions that reiterate their respective positions on the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands.
